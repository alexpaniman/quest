* Quest

** Building

*** Prerequisites
You need to have:

+ ~Clang~ 
+ ~CMake~
+ ~Ninja~

installed on your system.

On ~Arch Linux~ you can install all of them with:
#+begin_src shell
  pacman -Sy --needed cmake ninja clang
#+end_src

On ~Ubuntu~ you can install them with:

#+begin_src shell
  sudo apt-get install -y cmake ninja-build clang
#+end_src

If you are using other distros, use your package 
manager to look up package names, and install them.

*** Installation
*Clone this repository and cd to cloned directory:*

#+begin_src shell
  git clone git@github.com:alexpaniman/quest.git
  cd quest
#+end_src

*Then, create build directory and configure:*

#+begin_src shell
  mkdir -p build
  cd build
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  # Make sure that you use recent clang! Project uses some new features.
#+end_src

Optionally you can use ~-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON~ if you
want to import this project with ~clangd~ language server.

And ~-DFORCE_COLORED_OUTPUT=ON~ to get colorful diagnostics with ~Ninja~

Now build and run (you should still be in ~build~ directory):
#+begin_src shell
  cmake --build .
  ./compass-and-straightedge
#+end_src
